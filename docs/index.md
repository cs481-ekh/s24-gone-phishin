# Hook, Line, and Secure

## Abstract:
Ransomware and other malware is increasingly becoming a problem for individuals and organizations alike. This insidious malware is often distributed through convincing spear phishing emails which, with the advent of AI, have gotten increasingly sophisticated. Our small-footprint solution, “Hook, Line, and Secure”, is a browser extension which seeks to identify spear phishing and educate users through email scanning and the generation of a report. This extension aims to reduce the success of spear phishing attacks and improve user trust.
