                <h2>What is "Hook, Line, and Secure"</h2>
                <p>"Hook, Line, and Secure" is a browser extension designed to detect signs of phishing in gmail. The
                    extension will look for indicators of phishing like spelling errors, grammar errors, and keywords
                    commonly found in phishing emails. The extension then takes this information and uses it to calculate
                    a confidence score, telling the user how likely the email is to be phishing. The extension will break
                    down each element that factored into the score and direct the user to additional resources if they are
                    interested.

                <h2>What is our Goal?</h2>
                <p>We seek to not only identify phishing emails, but help our users learn about phishing in the process.
                    The extension will teach the user about various signs of phishing both when they are detected and when
                    they aren't, and give users the tools they need to stay cybersafe. We are hoping to use "Hook, Line, and Secure"
                    to help make the public more educated, and to help them avoid falling victim to phishing.
