        <br>
        <div class="intro">Hook, Line, and Secure is a Chrome extension that scans emails for the likelihood of it being phishing. It
            looks for spelling and grammar mistakes as well as keywords that can be indicative of phishing. It currently
            also detects the prescence of hyperlinks and attachments, but those do not yet factor into the confidence
            score.</div>

                <h2>Installation</h2>
                <p>This extension is not currently on the Chrome Web Store. To install it, download the .zip file and
                    extract its contents. Keep track of where you extract it to, as you will need to reference that in a
                    moment. Next, navigate to <a href="chrome://extensions/">chrome://extensions/</a> and select
                    "Developer Mode" in the top right corner. Finally, click "Load Unpacked" in the top left corner.
                    Navigate to the folder you unpacked earlier. To confirm this is the right folder, you can check for
                    the manifest.json file.

                <h2>Pop-up Options</h2>
                <p>Currently, there are two items in the Pop-up. The first is an On/Off toggle. This allows the "Tab"
                    button and sidebar to appear/disappear from the screen. The second is a help button, which it looks
                    like you already know how to use.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="helpItem">
                <h2>Basic Functionality</h2>
                <p>To open the sidebar with the analysis results, press the "Tab" button on the right side of the
                    screen. The screen will show you the Confidence Score generated as well as the items that
                    contributed to it. There is a button labeled "Rescan email" that can be used to scan the email
                    again. There is also a button labeled "More details" that will take you to a separate page and give
                    details about all the items discovered in the email.
